# Executive Summary

## Snapshot
- **Product**: Frontier Model Framework – pluggable RAG/LLM orchestration via YAML + CLI/SDK.
- **Quality bar**: Mature unit/integration suite (116 tests, 80% coverage) with strong connector/exporter fakes enabling offline runs.
- **Major strengths**:
  1. Modular layering (connectors → processing → inference → exporters) with clear extension points.
  2. Deterministic artefact pipeline (hash-based IDs, run manifests) supports reproducibility & audit.
  3. CLI/SDK symmetry (`--json`, `run_recipe_simple`) simplifies adoption for both ops and dev teams.
- **Key risks**:
  1. `chain.runner` (~880 LOC) and `cli.py` (~670 LOC) remain monolithic with complex branching—difficult to reason about and extend.
  2. Security automation missing (pip-audit, bandit); dependencies and auth flows rely on manual vigilance.
  3. Low coverage in tracing, table-row processing, and new orchestrator helper could mask regressions.

## Top Opportunities (90-day horizon)
1. **Refactor runtime core** – split `chain.runner` into pipeline stages; expose typed intermediates to reduce churn during feature work.
2. **Security & compliance** – add automated dependency scanning, bandit SAST, and secret detection to CI.
3. **Observability polish** – instrument retry/backoff telemetry, improve OTEL documentation, raise coverage on metrics/tracing modules.
4. **DX smoothing** – bundle working pip-enabled environment, ship focused quickstart doc, retire stale examples.
5. **Performance telemetry** – record per-step timings/tokens to highlight high-cost prompts and exporters.

## Readiness Assessment
| Dimension | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Architecture | ✅ Clear separations, provider/exporter factories ready for extension |
| Quality | ⚠️ Solid baseline tests, but hotspots unrefactored; add complexity tracking |
| Security | ⚠️ Manual processes only; introduce scanning before external release |
| Observability | ⚠️ Foundations exist (metrics/tracing), but instrumentation sparse |
| Developer UX | ✅ CLI/SDK ergonomics strong; onboarding docs need streamlining |

**Recommendation**: Treat refactoring/security/observability as parallel workstreams while preserving the stable CLI/SDK surface for early adopters.
